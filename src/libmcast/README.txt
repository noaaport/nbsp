The various versions developed through the years are archived in
the "archive" directory, along with an explanatory README there.

The src directory here started with the latest version in "mcast-current".

The version in nbsp/src is a copy (copied manually) of the one in src here.
This libmcast directory is kept under nbsp/src to avoid having
a separate repo for it.
