If excuted without options

./rate

it will use the default network interface. To use the second interface,
us either

./rate -i eth1

or

./rate -p 192.168.10.76

(For eth1 use the appropriate interface name (as reported by
ifconfig for example).

Without arguments it will try to read from the first noaaport channel

224.0.1.1 1201

To try to read from the other channels, put the ip and port in the arguments,
e.g.,

./rate -i eth1 224.0.1.2 1202
