 * The comment below is taken from the nreadn.c file in npemwin.
 * The content of this file is identical to that file.
 *
 * Mon Nov 18 21:30:19 AST 2024
 * This is a revised version of the original readn() functions.
 * The revision is to insert a function in the readn (and writen)
 * retry loop that can check the quit_flag (which is set by the
 * signal handler for example), to exit the retry loop. Ordinarily
 * that is not required (with small values of the timeout and the retry
 * arguments). But in the development of the emftp application,
 * it is more convenient to use something around 120 seconds
 * as the waiting time, to avoid the log message that npemwin 
 * emits each time it returns empty waiting for input.
 * But in that case, without the interrupt function the program
 * could block that long before exiting when receiving a quit instruction.
 * In the present version the correct thing to do is to keep the timeout
 * short (perhaps a few seconds) and increase the retry argument
 * conveniently (.e.g, 5 and 24, respectively).
 * In the present version, the retry interrupt function is set (optionally)
 * by calling init_readn() before using the readn/writen functions.

   *
   * In FreeBSD (at least up to 7.2), poll does not consider a FIFO
   * ready on eof. So, for a FIFO, the read() will never return
   * 0 here (either -1 or n > 0). But for network sockets, read() can return 0
   * because poll considers it ready if it has closed. Since we want to
   * know when the read() returns zero and when poll timed out,
   * we use the -2 for the latter case.
   * In Linux (and if FreeBSD removes the bug), FIFO's behave similarly.
   * Since 0 will never be returned for FIFOs in FreeBSD, there
   * the eof condition for FIFOs must be detected by calling read()
   * after this read1() returns -2; that read() should then return 0.
