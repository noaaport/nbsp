Project Information:

Project Descriptive Name:  TclUpperair
Project Unix Name:         tclupperair
CVS Server:                tclupperair.cvs.sourceforge.net

Project Administration:

The Project Admin page for your project may be accessed at https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=254308 after logging-in.


Service Availability for New Projects:

The DNS for your project web site may take up to 24 hours to become active.  Until DNS is active for your project, attempts to access your project web site will result in 404 errors.  Once DNS is active, you will see an empty directory index when accessing your project web site, until you have placed content in your project web space (remember: project web space is provided solely for use in storing project-related information; see the Web section of the Project Admin page for additional details).

Your access to the CVS servers (including your new CVS repository, which has already been initialized and is ready for your first import) are typically available within four hours from the time when your project was approved.  If after 6 hours your CVS accounts still do not work, please submit a Support Request (on the "alexandria" project, see below), so as that we may look in to the problem.


Site Documentation and Support:

SourceForge.net maintains a large amount of documentation about the SourceForge.net site and services offered to hosted projects.  This documentation may be accessed using the "Site Docs" link in the left navbar, or directly at:
    http://p.sf.net/sitedocs/index

Should you need to contact the SourceForge.net team, we may be reached by submitting a Support Request at:
    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=1&atid=200001


Reminder: Acceptable Use and Project Licensing:

By using the SourceForge.net site, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the SourceForge.net Terms of Use Agreement.

SourceForge.net provides hosting solely for Open Source software development projects; if your project is not being released under an Open Source license, or is not developing software, please contact the SourceForge.net team immediately for assistance. Questions regarding acceptable use of the SourceForge.net site and resources should be directed to the SourceForge.net team by submitting a Support Request (see above).


Donation System:

You may opt-in your user account to receive donations at:
    https://sourceforge.net/my/donate_manage.php

Getting Started:

A significant amount of project service information may be found on the Project Admin pages for your project, as seen at:
https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=254308

The Project Admin page for your project is the best place to start. Please ensure that you have established a suitable Public Description for your project, and have categorized your project within the Trove; both of these operations may be performed using the "Public Info" section of your Project Admin pages.


Enjoy the system, and please tell others about SourceForge.net. Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you (we can always be reached by submitting a Support Request on the "alexandria" project (see above)).
