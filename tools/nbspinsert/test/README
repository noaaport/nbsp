nbspinsert-test.c differs from nbspinsert.c only in the addition
of a sleep() call to test the locking mechanism of the fifo (for writing).

To execute the test, first create the fifo

mkfifo infeed.fifo

Then in one terminal execute

nbspinsert -f infeed.fifo 0 0 0 0 0 fname fpath

in another terminal

nbspinsert -f infeed.fifo 1 1 1 1 1 fname1 fpath1

The reader also prints the data received as a consistency check.
