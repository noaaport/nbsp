To start the nbspd daemon automatically out of the local rc.d directory,
set the variable

nbspd=1

in /etc/rc.conf, and a line such as

[ -x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nbspd ] && /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nbspd start

in the file /etc/rc.local.

The configuration files are installed in /usr/local/etc/nbsp.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/noaaport, and already enabled the rstfilter and dafilter.
In addition the web server is enabled by default, and can be
accesed as
	
	http://localhost:8015
or
	http://<hostname>:8015

The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

A cron job should be installed to remove old leftover files;
a sample hourly script is in the doc directory, and it has been
copied to

	/usr/local/etc/periodic/hourly

A line such as

0 * * * * /usr/local/etc/periodic/hourly/nbsp > /var/log/nbsp.hourly 2>&1 

can be added to root's crontab.
