To start the nbspd daemon automatically out of the local rc.d directory,
set the variable

nbspd_enable=1

in /etc/rc.conf.local.

The configuration files are installed in /usr/local/etc/nbsp.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/noaaport, and already enabled the rstfilter and dafilter.
In addition the web server is enabled by default, and can be
accesed as
	
	http://localhost:8015
or
	http://<hostname>:8015

The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

As of version 2.0.r2, nbspd runs as user noaaport, and therefore
the directories where the daemon writes must be owned by that user:

    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/noaaport
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/noaaport
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/nbsp
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/run/nbsp

During a fresh install, the package installer will create the
directories with the appropriate ownership, but not during an upgrade.
If you are uprading from an older version, those commands must be
executed manually.

See the files

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp/defaults/nbspd.conf
	/usr/local/etc/nbsp/dist/sysctl.conf-ex

for sysctl notes. NOTE: Alternatively execute 'nbspconfigure-dvbs2' and
it will carry out the steps indicated in those files.
-

To configure Nbsp with a memory based spool for a pure ingest role
(no processing but network aware and the inventory enabled), execute

	nbspreconfigure mspoolbdb

and check the files in

	defaults/configs

Executing 'nbspreconfigure' without arguments, will revert to the
standard default configuration.
