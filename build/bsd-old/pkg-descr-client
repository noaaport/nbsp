This is a set of client programs for the Noaaport Broadcast System Processor.
Nbsp receives the multicast transmission of a noaaport system attached
to a local network, and processes and stores the received files.
Facilities are provided for filtering and saving only those products
of interest, postprocessing them in various ways, and
redistributing the data to local or remote clients. The set of programs
in this package allow to browse and display the grib files in either
the local or remote computer running nbsp, using GrADS.
