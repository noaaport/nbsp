The rstfilter can produce loop sequences of the radar
and satellite images. The relevant settings are commented out
in the ``rstfilter.conf'' file.

(For generating radar image loop image files using the command line scripts
see nbspradmapc.README).

The functionality is enabled by setting the variables

	set rstfilter(radloop_enable) 1
	set rstfilter(satloop_enable) 1

in that file. The default program used is gifsicle,
but others can be used. The program is called with a cmd line
equivalent of

	<program> <preoptions> <files> <postoptions> > <outputfile>

where the <preoptions> and <postoptions> are the settings in the
variables (e.g., for the radar loops)

	rstfilter(radloop_program_preoptions)
	rstfilter(radloop_program_postoptions)

respectively. Thus, for example, to create an endless loop,
with a 2 second delay between the last frame and the start of the
next sequence, the following can be used
(in the first line the character is the letter "ell", in the second it is
the number "one")

	set rstfilter(radloop_program_preoptions) {-l}
	set rstfilter(radloop_program_postoptions) {-d 200 #-1}

To make a loop that repeats the sequence only three times

	set rstfilter(radloop_program_preoptions) {-l 3}

In any case, adding the "-O2" option (capital letter 'O') in the postoptions
can be useful to optimize the animations.

The variable "rstfilter(radloop_regex)" determines for which
sites and type combinations the loops are generated. Its format is similar to
the variable "rstfilter(rad_regex)". The latter determined which images
are generated, and the former the loops.

The variables for the satellite images have an analogous meaning.

Note that the radar images require that gempak be installed since
they are generated sing the gpmap_gif program. The satellite images
do not require gempak.
