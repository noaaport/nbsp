# Read until the line that starts with "re_len=" is found. Then read
# up to the line with "HEADER=END" to get to the start of the records,
# and then unpack each record until the line with "DATA=END" is found.
# The records are unpacked by calling nbspqdc, which essentially uses
# the unpack() functions in the nbsp sources src/packfpu.{h,c}.
