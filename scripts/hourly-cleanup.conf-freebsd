# This is the configuration file for the hourly script.
# It deletes files in the specified directories that are
# older than the specified time or based on a retention count.
#
# This file is searched for first in the main configuration directory, then
# in the defaults and finally the site subdirectory. All the three files are
# read, and the last configuration line for each given <dir> is used.
#
# Therefore, any "defaults" and/or "site" versions of this file need to
# contain only the lines that override the defaults set in this file
# and not a copy of this entire file.
#
# The lines are of one of the following two the forms:
#
# <timespec>:<dir>:<expression>
# <timespec>:<dir>:<exclude subdirs>:<expression>
#
# In the first form, `find' is applied to <dir>. In the second form, `find'
# is applied to the subdirectories of <dir>, excluding the subdirectories
# whose names match the regular expression <exclude subdirs>.
#
# <expression> is the time specification expression that is passed to find,
# or an option string that can have two forms.
#
# The first form is -c <count> [-d] [-e <excludelist>] indicating
# a retention count and optionally a regexp specifying file names to
# exclude from the deletion list. For example, alternative specifications
# for the digatmos/nexrad directory could be
#
# H/2:/var/noaaport/data/digatmos/nexrad/nids: -mtime +4h
# H/2:/var/noaaport/data/digatmos/nexrad/nids: -c 60 -e latest|list
#
# A retention count can be specified only if the files in the directory
# and its subdirectories are saved with a date-time based name so that
# they sort according to their age.
#
# If the "-d" is given, then the subdirectories of <dir> are treated as files
# instead of being processed recursively. This is useful, for example, when
# when <dir> has subdirectories with names like 20090223 20090224.
#
# The second form of <expression> is "-i <options>", where the -i indicates
# that the directory <dir> contains inventory files rather than the data files
# themselves. The <options> are passed to find to get the inventory files
# that meet the criteria. Then the inventory files are read one by one
# and all the files referenced in them are deleted, and finally the inventory
# file itself is deleted. Therefore an alternative specification for the
# digamots/nexrad directory is
#
# H/2:/var/noaaport/data/inv/digatmos/nexrad/nids: -i -mtime +4h
#
# The time specification is one of
#
# H		=> run every hour
# H=ll|mm|nn	=> run at the hours in the list
# H/n		=> run if the remainder of the (current hour)/n is zero. 
#
# D=ddhh|d'd'h'h'|...	=> run at the days of the month and hours in the list.
#			   Here the dd is between 01-31.
# Dhh|h'h'|.../n	=> run if the remainder of (current day of month)/n
#			   is zero and the current hour is in the list.
#			
# W=dhh|d'h'h'|...	=> run at the days of the week and hours in the list.
#			   Here the d is between 0-6 with 0 = sunday.
# Whh|h'h'|.../n	=> run if the remainder of (current day of week)/n
#			   is zero and the current hour is in the list.
#
# If the time specification ends in "g" then it is taken to be relative to gmt.
#
# Examples
#
# H/3  => run at 0, 3, 6, ...
# H=03|09|18|23  => run at 03, 09, 18 and 23.
# H=03|09|18|23g => same as above but in gmt
# W=523 => run on fridays at 11 pm
# D=0101 => run on the first of the month at 1 am.
# D03|21/2  => run every other day at 3 am and 9 pm.

# Delete processed files in the data directory.
# Note that the "digatmos/{hurricane,enso}" subdirectory is excluded;
# "data/track" is not included.
# The metarfilter takes care of itself so "data/metar" is not included.
# The metar/upperair/ws archives are enabled by default; the setting below
# allows seven days of daily and hourly archives.

H=23:/var/noaaport/nbsp/spool: -mtime +1

# If the parameter "spooldbslots" is not zero in the nbspd.conf file
# (the default is not zero), then the spool directory is managed
# by nbsp itself.
# However, in case of errors it is possible that a file may not be
# deleted when it should. While rare, this is posible.
# Therefore, as a precaution, the spool directory is here checked
# once a day (at 23:00), for such possible leftover files.
#
# If the "spooldbslots" parameter is set to zero then the following settings
# or something similar could be used, or a completely independent scheme
# should be implemented.
