gpfilter -
  radmos - Designed to do radar mosaics, using native gempak tools
           for that purpose, without much intervention from us.
           We ended up not using it (but it is there!).

gisfilter -
  gismsap [nbspgis(rad,sat,goesr)map]
   - Designed to do maps using mapserver. In practice we ended using it
     only for sat, and now for goesr.

rstfilter - radmap, satmap
     Designed to do sat and rad images, with maps, using gempak/gpmap_gif.
     In practice we ended up using it only for rad. 
           
Summary: radmos is not being used, while the gisfilter/gismap tools
are used for goesr, and the rstfilter/radmap  is used for rad.
