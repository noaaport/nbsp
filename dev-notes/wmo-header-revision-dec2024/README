The files in "sample" were selected from the kwbc directory to test
the validate_wmo() function (as explained in the validate_wmo.c file).
The file "kwbc_ubca90...." is an example of the kind of error
that we introduced when adding the option to include the "bbb".
(The error was in the use of the sscanf() function in src/sbn.c
without checking if the first line of the wmo header actually
contains the bbb; i.e., whether the line has four or three elements.)

The revision (and the new functions) are in the file "src/sbn.c".
