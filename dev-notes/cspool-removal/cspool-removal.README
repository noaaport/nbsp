** As stated in "conf/features.conf.cspool", the cspool in the nbsp server
has never been operational. The "conf/nbspd.conf.cspool" file has the
corresponding settings, but both are obsolete files kept only for documentation
purposes.

** The filters have some infrastructure setup for using the cspool,
if/when that is properly implemented in the server. Since long ago
I decided to not implement the cspool because tests showed that it
was not efficient, and expressed the intention to remove that
extra infrastructure in the filters and the filterlib.  So here I am
listing the places where the revisions have to be made.

DONE * Make a comment in "conf/nbspd.conf.cspool" similar to the one in
"conf/features.conf.cspool"

DONE * Remove the cspoolbdb files in filterslib/tcl
DONE * Do not install the nbspcspoolr file (src/libcspool)

  (We can leave the source files, as testing toold, but eliminate
  the reference to the cspool application).

DONE * The files listed in

- query_enable.txt
- filterlib_cspool_nbspfile.txt

must be revised to eliminate the reference(s) to the cspool framework.

DONE * The files listed in

- background_processing.txt

must be revised to determine if the background processing framework
must be deleted.

DONE * The files listed in

- cspoolbdb.txt

must be revised to eliminate the reference to the cpoolbdb files.

DONE * The files in filterlib_cspool_nbspfile.txt
  - dafilter
  - gribfilter
  - gisfilter

DONE * All files listed in "filterlib_init.txt" were revised to delete the
lines "filterlib_init" and "filterlib_end" sorrounding the call to main {}.

DONE * Finally the files listed in

- cspool.txt

must checked to see if anyone of the skipped the previous checks.

===========================================================================
These are the files revised/checked:

* filterslib:

filters.conf
filters.lib
Makefile.in
pkgIndex
cspoolbdb.{tcl,conf} - deleted

* src/spoolbdb/cli

Makefile.in (edited - removed installation of nbspcspoolr)
cspoolr.c (edited - removed comment about the cspoolrpipe.tcl tool)
cspoolrpipe.tcl (deleted)
tcl examles deleted in cli/examples

* dafilter

dalib-rad
dalib-sat
dalib-file

* gisfilter

gisfilter.tcl
gislib-rad.tcl

* gribfilter
gribfilter.tc.in

* gpfilter
-- gpfilter.tcl.in

* All files listed in "filterlib_init.txt" were revised to delete the
lines "filterlib_init" and "filterlib_end" sorrounding the call to main {}.
