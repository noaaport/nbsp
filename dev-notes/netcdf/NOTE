When working on the goesrcsv program I discovered an issue in netcdf.
In freebsd (and linux) I can use in the main program

atexit(cleanup)
fd = open()

and put the close() in cleanup(). This is illustrated in "ux.c".

The analogous calls in netcdf

atexit(cleanup)
ncid = nc_open()

and nc_close() in cleanup() does not work (this is illustrated in "nc-bad.c").

The way it works in netcdf is to use the calls in the sequence

ncid = nc_open()
atexit(cleanup)

and possibly further calls like

nc_close()
nc_open()

But the point is that netcdf apparently must be initialized somehow
before atexit().

By pure guess, I found the function nc_initialized(),and the sequence

nc_initialize()
atexit()
ncid = nc_open()

does work in netcdf. This illustrated in "nc-bad.c", if the
nc_initialize call line is uncommented.

In summary, my preferred way to use it is as shown in "nc.c".
