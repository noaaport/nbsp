# This file can be edited to enable or disable some of the filters or services.
# The modified copy should be placed in the site subdirectory,
# so that it will not be overwritten when the nbsp package is reinstalled.
#
# In the filters a setting of 0 disabled the filter; 1 enables the filter in
# "single" mode, and 2 enables a "working crew". At this moment, the following
# filters support this setting:
#
#	dafilter
#	rstfilter
#	gpfilter
#	gribfilter
#
# (Note the enabling the emwin server disables the working crew setting
# of the rstfilter.)

# Spool configuration - (see mspoolbdb.README)
#
# 1 => The default value 1 uses the file system disk spool exclusively
# 2 => A (private) memory bdb spool (mspool)
# 3 => A (private) memory bdb spool (mspool) with fs based dbenv
# 4 => A file-backed bdb spool (cspool)            (not yet operational)
# 5 => A (shared) memory based cspool              (not yet operational)
#
# If the private mspool configuration (2,3) is set here, the nbs1 server
# is automatically enabled, and all the filters are disabled, including
# the netfilter. To fine-tune the configuration, including enabling
# the inventory and netfilter, copy the files
#
#    cp dist/nbspd-mspoolbdb.conf-ex     site/nbspd.conf
#    cp dist/netfilter-mspoolbdb.conf-ex site/netfilter.conf
#
# and use them as the starting point to complete the local setup.
# On the other hand, if the cache spool (4) or (5) is enabled, then consult the
# file "cspoolbdb.conf" in order to configure the filters to use the
# spool cache.
