# Sample configuration file for nbspd

# This configuration file uses the tcl language.
#
# In most simple cases, in which the desired configuration amounts to disable
# or enable one or more feature (e.g, a filter or built-in server)
# it can be achived by adjusting one or more settings in the file
# "features.conf". In that case, creating and adjusting that file is
# all that is needed. (The features.conf-sample file can be used as
# the starting point, after renaming it to "features.conf", or
# "site/features.conf".)
#
set _featuresconf [list "/usr/local/etc/nbsp/features.conf" \
			"/usr/local/etc/nbsp/defaults/features.conf" \
			"/usr/local/etc/nbsp/site/features.conf"];
set _featuresinit "/usr/local/libexec/nbsp/features.init"
if {[file exists ${_featuresinit}]} {
    source ${_featuresinit};
}
 
# For more fine-grained configuration settings, the rest of this file
# can be used.
#
# All options are commented out by the three '###' symbols. 
# What they show are the default values hard-coded in the program.
#
# The program will read first this file, and then the files
# "defaults/nbspd.conf" and "site/nbspd.conf", in that order, if they exist.
# Latter settings override ealier ones. Thus, although this file can be edited
# the recommended procedure is to create the file "site/nbspd.conf"
# and add the configuration settings there.

# nbspd will run as the user that starts the program (usually root)
# unless configured otherwise. If the user and group options are set,
# then the commands equivalent to the following must be executed
# (with the correct user:group)
#
#	chown -R user:group /var/noaaport
#	chown -R user:group /var/log/noaaport
#	chown -R user:group /var/run/nbsp

# user and group to run as, and default umask

# By default, the interface to use is chosen by the kernel. In a
# multihomed machine, the interface to use can be specified either by

# mspoolbdb spool is enabled, the following are required:
# - only the nbs1 server can be enabled (only nbs1 clients can be served;
#   the nbs2 and emwin servers must not be enabled).
# - all the filters must be disabled. The only filters that can be left
#   are the netfilter and the inventory.

#
# These define ndb = 4 databases, with each database configured such
# that it can hold the files received in about 1 minutes (60 MB).
# This requires 240 MB + 20% (overhead) of free memory, to hold a backlog
# of 4 minutes of data. The "nslots = 4" parameter configure 4 reading buffers
# for retrieving the data from the db to send it to the nbs1 network clients.
# Since there is only one reader, the network server, Nslots can set to 1.
# Each db is not allowed to grow larger than (maxsize_per128/128) in order

# When a slave reads from multiple masters, it is possible that it will
# receive duplicates of the same file, depending on what each master
# is configured to send. This option can be used to enable the detection
# (and rejection) of such duplicates, and it is set in the default
# configuration.
#
### set slave_reject_duplicates 1

# The local feed slave mode (used, e.g., by the inn nntp feed) when
# the feedmode above is set to (or includes) 4.
#
### set infeedfifo	"/var/run/nbsp/infeed.fifo"
### set infeedfifomode	0660
### set infeedfifogrp	"news"

# The next parameter is a string that hold the regular expressions
# for the accept filter. In the default configuration nothing 
# is set, which means that everything is accepted and saved in the spool
# directory.
# 
# The algorithm works as follows. If the expression is not set, then everything
# is accepted. If it is set but empty (i.e., set to ""), then nothing is
# accepted. Otherwise the expression should be a comma-separated list of RE's,
# some of which may be negated by putting exclamation sign before the RE.
#
# For example,
#
#	set acceptpatt {.*,!kwal}
#
# The file name is matched against each pattern in the list, from left to
# right. If no match is found, the file is rejected. Otherwise, the file
# is accepted if and only if the right-most pattern that matched was
# not negated. The special string ".*", is a match-all pattern.
# Some examples are given below.
#
# In the default configuration, most RE parameters (with the exceptions noted
# below) are not set (they are NULL), so everything passes.
#
### set acceptpatt	

# The next parameters are similar, but they control what products the
# processor sends to the filter and the server queues for postprocessing.
#
### set filterqacceptpatt	
### set serverqacceptpatt	
 
# The next parameters are similar, but they control what products the
# server distributes to clients.
#
### set nbs1acceptpatt
### set nbs2acceptpatt
### set emwinacceptpatt	

# Files with names matching this pattern are saved in the spool directory
# in compressed form if they are transmitted in that form
# (e.g., radar data, sat images). To uncompress all those files on the fly,
# use (since no file name will match it)
#
#    set savezacceptpatt ""
#
# while a setting like
#
#    set savezacceptpatt "_(sdus[2357]|tig)"
#
# leaves compressed the radar and satellite files and uncompresses the rest.
# However, a better alternative is to leave the uncompression for the
# postprocessing phase by the filters, which is the default setting. 
#
### set savezacceptpatt

# A record of the received files can be kept in a db to monitor
# retransmissions and avoid processing duplicate files. The db
# operations can be expensive so inserting all records can be degrade
# performance more than help. This filter can be configured so that only
# certain files are monitored for retransmissions. The files placed here
# should be those for which the cost of reprocessing is more than
# the overhead of the db management. The default is to insert everything,
# which means that retransmissions are not reprocessed if the original file
# was received well.
#
# set rtxdbacceptpatt
#
# For example, to monitor the retransmission of only grib and bufr files,
# a setting like
#
# set rtxdbacceptpatt	{\+(grib|bufr)}
#
# can be used.

#
# Examples
#

# To acept files only from the San Juan station
#
### set acceptpatt	{tjsj}

# To accept only from the San Juan station and the National Hurricane Center
# (the character in the middle is a vertical bar "|"),
# both of these do the same thing
#
### set acceptpatt		{tjsj|knhc}
### set acceptpatt		{tjsj,knhc}

# To accept everything except one station,
#
### set acceptpatt		{.*,!kwal}

# The same thing but allowing some files from kwal
#
### set acceptpatt		{.*,!kwal,kwal_xxxx}

# To accept only from stations with names starting with kw, but
# rejecting "kwal"
#
### set acceptpatt		{^kw,!^kwal}

# To accept anything except grib or bufr files
#
## set acceptpatt	{.*,!\+(grib|bufr)}

# To accept only metars
#
## set acceptpatt	{_s[ap]}

# To accept anything except metars
#
## set acceptpatt	{.*,!_s[ap]}

# An alternative to setting the values of those strings directly here
# is to read them from an external file using a tcl construct such as
# 
### set acceptpatt	[exec cat "/usr/local/etc/nbsp/noaaport.accept"]

#
# Directories containing the local overrrides
