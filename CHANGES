2.0r3 -
=====

- Revised nbspradmap to define the gpmap(radinfo,xxx) variables that
  can be used in the radmap.rc script (xx = lat, lon, height, seconds,
  mode, code). Required the introduction of the [-h] option in the
  nbspradmapxxx scripts to distinguish the cases in which the input
  file has the gempak header (e.g., from diagtmos/nexrad) or it doesn't
  (like the tmp files in filter_rad in the rstfilter.lib).
  In the case of the uncompressed files nbspradinfo needs to know
  how much header to skip before looking for the data, and this option
  is needed to determine the size of the header.

- Added -s option to logrotate in scheduler.conf-generic so that
  logrotate can write its status file in a directory that is
  writable by the "noaaport" user.

- Added "Bytes Ranges" header handling capability in tclhttpd, to support
  the IDV catalogs.

- Added support for IDV catalogs to tclhttpd in the form of the
  catalog "extension".

- Added permament archive to the metarfilter (in archive.conf).

- Added hostname to the <head><title> tag in the main index file,
  which is now a tml tamplate file. The same change was made in
  npemwin y npstats.

- Revised the craftinsert script to set the umask before creating the
  subdirectories and the data file in the spool directory (that now
  requires tclx). Needed so that the nbsp cleanup scripts can delete
  the files written in the spool by ldm (under the noaaport group).

- Revised io.c in the gpfilter/c directory to add the the fopen_xxx
  functions. In particular fopen_output locks the output file
  so that it is safe to execute several instances of nbspfile
  in parallel even in append mode and if the output file is the same. 
  nbspfile was updated to use the new functions.

- Revised the various filters that process the satellite files to
  allow them to process the non-goes data files (i.e., they now process
  ther tixyyy files besides tigyyy).

- Added the ability to specify the queue_read_timeout_ms on a per-client
  basis (via the clientoptions string in nbspd.conf).

2.1.r1 -
======

- Revised nbspmtr plot scripts and tclhttpd metar functions to
  plot the wind direction as well (suggested by Scott <ssshoema@gmail.com>).
- Added -r and -R options to the nbspmtrplot1 script.
- Text files are filetered through tr in the rstfilter to delete cntrl chars.
- Added -e to nbspsat and nbspsatinfo (to extract the lat-lon parameters).
- Added option(s) to set servername to the wildcard address(es).
- Added "digatmos" as default subdir for the catalog extension
  if no suubdir is specified in the /_catalog url.
- Fixed syntax error in filters.lib when processing the new rad files
  (nbspradinfo -> exec nbspradinfo). As a result of the error, the
  rc(rad...) variables were not being properly set for the new files.
  Some of the variables are used in the info files of the gisfilter
  shapefiles.
- Added the gisfilter.
- Added "gis" subdir to the catalog extension - The nids files are
  saved with the WCT naming conventions.
- Completed the gini to shapefile conversion in the nbspgis library.
- Added gini to asc conversion to the nbspgis librray.

2.2.1r
-
- Added the clusterfilter (executes filters in remote nodes).
- Eliminated setting of usprcvsize in linux (to enable autotuning) - instead
  output a message at package installation regerding the setting of
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_max_dist=0
- Added kgge to metarfilter (icao and st files)
- Added linespoints style (ls) keywords to gnuplot templates in metarfilter
- Revised nbspstatcounters to output stats data in various formats (std, xml,
  csv, csvk) for use locally by e.g., collectd, rrdtool, npstats.
- Added inbsp extension for exporting nbspstatcounters data via web interface
  (for use remotely in, e.g., collectd, rrdtool, npstats)
- Added nbspreconfigure script (mspoolbdb, reconfigure)
- Added nbspstats script
- Revised msgfilter: convert crlf -> nl, corrected README, added options
  for smtp when needed. Revised specification to allow
  <prod_regex><site_regexp> in addition to the old <prod_regex>_<zone_regexp>.
- Added output of logperiods (for stats and qstate) in nbspstatcounters
  and in the "_inbsp/stats" web interface. The script nbspstats was revised
  to accept a "-p <logperiod>" option.
- Fixed problem with filter queue growing with several slaves in
  mempsool mode (spoolslots.c missing a pthred_cond_signal() call).
- In the gpfilter, each decoder is opened with a "permanent" pipe.
- Revised (and corrected) the statistic plots: Added size in fmtoptions
  in inventory.conf (and removed set size in template files), and
  corrected the template setting for the -r option in nbspstatplot1.
- Revised nbspradmap and nbspradmapc such that the later can create
  loops from the individual images.
- Added nbspsatmapc for similar purposes and revised the web server
  to generate radar and sat loops dynamically.
- Fixed error in rstfilter.lib creating sat maps (reported by Bill Dosser);
  check of rstfilter(satmap_regex) should be with uwildmat and not just regex.
- Revised default bundle configuration of gisfilter.
- Revised and corrected: tclupperair, uafilter and wsfilter
- Revised tclgrads such that Expect is no longer used. (The Expect
  package is no longer required in the main package. It is still used
  in the sample shell applications.)

2.2.2
-
- Revision of nbspgribrsh (and the companion catalog tools)
- Added -nobody in call to filterslib in gribfilter
- Added nbspgisradmap and nbspgissatmap
- Revised msgfilter to add appropriate headers to the message. Added
  separate function to send sms messages using sendmail in case
  tcllib based function does not work for some addresses
- Removed binary options in fconfigure in Tclgrads that eliminated
  problems with gfs_161.tcl hanging in SL-6.1.
- Add K4M9 to metarfilter (Jason Brooks)
- Fixed the problem with dcgrib2 (reported by Jason Brooks) by calling
  fconfigure with binary options after opening the pipe to the decoders.
- Revised locking mechanism in the dynamic generation of sat images

2.2.2.r4
- nbspmtrd (Cosmetic change: Corrected optlist)
- nbspmtrplotdat revised
- Added arcfilter
- Fixed pipe.m4 (gpfilter.rc) the dcuair entry (extra -d)

2.2.2.r4
- Renamed g.saveframefmt to g.spoolsavefmt (and the related changes
  in nbspd.conf and defaults.h.in (for its possible use in the arcfilter)
- Corrected call to nbspradinfo in filters.lib to add the -C option
  when the spool files are saved without the ccb and the file being processed
  is not uncompressed with nbspunz.
